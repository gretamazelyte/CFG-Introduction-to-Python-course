Files included:
- Folder with CSV data;
- Small set code file which was used to analyse small data set provided by the CFG (data set not included).
- Review.txt which shows what results are produced after using extension code on large sales data set.
- Project extension code file which is the main code we used to analyse the large sales data set.
- My extension code part is a code that I created for the extension code. I wanted to separate it and include it to show individual part of the code.
